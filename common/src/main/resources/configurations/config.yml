# See: https://api.minetools.eu/uuid/
# This can be changed to any API you like, as long as the name / uuid is an URL parameter.
# The return type also MUST BE JSON + the json response MUST contain:
# - The "name" key for uuid to name convertion
# - The "id" key for name to uuid convertion (or uuid key if id key was not found).
#
# This should not be used often, at this time (05/08/2021), it is only being used for the Importer tool.

  # It's recommended to use MYSQL, POSTGRESQL or MARIADB for storage.
